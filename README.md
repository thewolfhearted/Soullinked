# Soullinked
A datapack made by Thewolfhearted built to either build or destroy friendships, your choice. Built for 3 or more players
# How it works
A centerpoint based on the average point of all players will damage anyone more than 15 blocks(changeable in settings) away, forcing everyone to stick together.
Also, if one player dies, everyone dies(can be turned off in settings) and will be added to the blame board (can also be turned off). 
Use "/function sl:config" to change settings
