# Soullinked
A datapack made by Thewolfhearted built to either build or destroy friendships, your choice. Built for 3 or more players
# How it works
A centerpoint based on the average centerpoint of all players will damage anyone more than 15 blocks away(changeable in settings) and if one player dies, 
they get added to the "Blame Board"(can be disabled), killing all players(can also be disabled).
